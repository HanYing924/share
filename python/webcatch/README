@247840 introduced the problem in third_party/libvpx (build x86 with neon), and @248040 fixed it. Adopted the solution of @248040.

[20140126 10:25:00]
@244572 introduced the problem in third_party/libyuv (-mfpu=neon for linker), and @244600 fixed it. Adopted the solution of @244600.

[20140122 10:47:00]
@234913 introduced the problem in third_party/openssl (__int128), and @234919 fixed it. Adopted the solution of @234919.

[20140114 23:55:00]
@238630 introduced the usage of gomacc for distributed building, but I couldn't find it. Just disable it using 'android_gyp -Duse_goma=0'.

236727 introduced chrome/browser/component_updater/test/update_manifest_unittest.cc, which has conflict with chrome/common/extensions/update_manifest_unittest.cc.It reports following errors: '''
bash -c "source build/android/envsetup.sh --target-arch=x86 && android_gyp -Dwerror=" would report error:

static library /workspace/project/gyagp/webcatch/project/chromium-android/src/chrome/chrome.gyp:unit_tests#target has several files with the same basename:
  update_manifest_unittest: browser/component_updater/test/update_manifest_unittest.cc common/extensions/update_manifest_unittest.cc
Some build systems, e.g. MSVC08, cannot handle that.

found that "disable_nacl=1" build was broken by checkin @235053, and fixed by @235114. So the build with @235055 was broken. Hacked the builds [235053, 235114) with the fix in @235114.
